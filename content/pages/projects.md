#### Hacker School

##### [reGrouper](http://github.com/katrinae/grouper) and [Seating Chart Creator](http://github.com/katrinae/SeatingChartCreator) (2014)

reGrouper is a tool for placing people in groups across multiple time periods
(for example, assigning students to reading groups that switch each month) in
a way that minimizes the number of times individuals are paired more than
once. Both its backend and its GUI are written in Python.

reGrouper is a pared-down version of an earlier application called [Seating
Chart Creator](/seating-chart-saga.html), which was built for a more specific
use case.

##### [WiFi-Controlled Toy Car](https://github.com/jdotjdot/B_FURIOUS) (2014)

A fellow Hacker Schooler and I replaced the radio-frequency controller in a
toy car with an Arduino.

##### [Arduino WiFi Shield Patch](/arduino-debugging.html) (2014)

While building an Arduino-controlled car, I ran into major problems with the
Arduino WiFi shield. I managed to fix part of the problem... but unfortunately
not all of it.

##### [Phonebook](https://github.com/KatrinaE/phonebook) (2014)

Phonebook is a small Python command-line tool for storing names and phone
numbers. It was built for one of Hacker School's Friday code challenges.

#### Pre-Hacker School

##### [AutoLex](https://github.com/KatrinaE/autolex) (2010)

AutoLex is a Django module enabling automatic translations via the Google
Translate API. Google has since shut down this service, rendering the module
obsolete.

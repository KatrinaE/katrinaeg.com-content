This is the code and content used to generate [katrinaeg.com](http://www.katrinaeg.com).

A rough guide:

* Articles live in _content/_
* Static pages (like the About Me page) live in _content/pages/_
* Images live in _content/images/_
* Pelican settings live in _pelicanconf.py_
* The theme (CSS and templates) lives in _themes/foundation-default-colours_,
which is a git submodule pointing to my fork of
[foundation-default-colours](https://github.com/KatrinaE/foundation-default-colours).
* The output (the actual site contents) lives in _output/_. It is also copied
to [katrinae.github.io](https://github.com/KatrinaE/katrinae.github.io).
